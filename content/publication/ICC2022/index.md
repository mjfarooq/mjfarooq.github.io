abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a convenient choice for carrying mobile base stations to rapidly setup communication services for ground users. Unlike terrestrial networks, UAVs do not have fiber optic back-haul connectivity except when they are tethered to the ground, which restricts their mobility. In the absence of back-haul, e.g., in remote areas, emergency situations, or in battlefields, there is a need to ensure connectivity among UAVs in addition to coverage of ground users for creating local area networks. This paper provides a distributed and dynamic approach for UAV formation-based control for coverage and connectivity of spatially dispersed users. We use flocking dynamics as a guide to constructing tailored formations of UAVs on the fly. Simulation results demonstrate that if sufficient aerial base stations are available, the proposed approach results in a strongly connected network of UAVs that is able to provide both a backhaul and fronthaul network. The approach can be further extended to create multi-tier extra-terrestrial networks to cater for large-scale applications.
