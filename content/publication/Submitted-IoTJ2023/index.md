abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising solution to enhance the performance and coverage of the fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, especially in remote areas, disasters-struck regions or mission-critical operations. They can successfully enhance and extend the coverage of cellular base stations (BSs) and provide on-demand wireless communications to ground users in these scenarios. However, the user locations can be arbitrary and an orchestration of UAVs may be needed to provide coverage to distant set of users over multiple hops. One of the key enhancements in 5G networks, i.e., integrated access and backhaul (IAB) provides the ability to use access links for backhaul communications. This can be leveraged to create multi-hop UAV orchestrations for service delivery to ground users. To enable efficient and high performance end-to-end quality of service (QoS) for users, the UAVs are required to maintain strong backhaul connectivity, while ensuring maximum coverage to ground users. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a dynamic, real-time approach based on deep reinforcement learning for end-to-end performance optimization in a UAV-assisted cellular network. We use a reward function based on the fronthaul and backhaul data rates to maximize the performance of users while ensuring a connected UAV network formation. Our evaluation is based on different scenarios demonstrating that the proposed method can achieve the autonomous placement of UAVs and effectively balances the tradeoff between backhaul and fronthaul links for optimized IAB performance.
