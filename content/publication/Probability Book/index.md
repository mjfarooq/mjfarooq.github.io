abstract: This book provides a set of problems and their solutions in undergraduate probability arranged according to topics to help both instructors and students. This has evolved out of classroom material at NYU Tandon School of Engineering over the course of three years. It is designed as a companion volume to “Lecture Slides on Undergraduate Engineering Probability” by U. Pillai and S. Dutta. The material covers basic probability, probability density/distribution functions, their properties, finding the probability density function of one function of one and two random variables, mean, variance, covariance, correlation coefficient, conditional density functions and characteristic functions. The practice problems and their solutions here should help the students at the undergraduate level to achieve mastery on the fundamental topics in probability. Moreover, this will hopefully facilitate the instructors in preparing homework material for their courses.
