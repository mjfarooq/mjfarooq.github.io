abstract: In this paper, we investigate the energy procurement decision of cellular networks powered by smart grid. Multiple retailers producing energy from different sources characterized by their prices and pollutant emission levels are available to power the network. The green cellular operator, constrained by a maximum tolerated level of CO2 emissions and quality of service (QoS) requirements, has to decide the optimal quantity of energy to procure from each retailer in order to minimize the energy cost and hence maximize its profit. Operators also provide multiple services to their subscribers characterized by the quality of the received signal and the probability of coverage. In this study, we employ stochastic geometry to determine the average power required per user to achieve the target probability of coverage which is then used to find the total base station power consumption. The resulting power requirements of the network are used in the optimization problem to find the optimal amount of energy to procure from each retailer. Our results illustrate the procurement behavior of cellular networks versus the CO2 emission threshold and the QoS requirements of the subscribers.
