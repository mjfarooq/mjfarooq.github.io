abstract: This paper develops a modeling framework, based on stochastic geometry and queueing theory, for carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) coordinated inter-vehicle communication, with unsaturated buffers, in a multi-lane highway scenario. We show that the spectrum sensing threshold (ρth) of the CSMA protocol is a critical design parameter that imposes a tradeoff between the transmission success probability and the spatial frequency reuse. To this end, we show that there exists an optimal value for ρth, which maximizes the transmission capacity that depends on the highway setup and the traffic intensity.
