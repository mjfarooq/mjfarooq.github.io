abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being successfully used to deliver communication services in applications such as extending the coverage of 5G cellular networks in remote areas, emergency situations, and enhancing the service quality in regions of dense user populations. While optimized placement solutions have been proposed in literature for ensuring quality of service (QoS) of users, they may not be ideal in highly mobile, autonomous, and diverse network scenarios. This paper proposes a proactive and resilient framework for distributed and dynamic orchestration of UAV small cells to provide QoS differentiation in the network. The UAV locations are tailored to end-user locations and service needs while ensuring that UAVs maintain localized backhaul connectivity. Simulation experiments show that under scenarios where physical placement can achieve service differentiationâ€™ the developed framework leads to a stable configurations of UAVs satisfying above 90% of user QoS requirements.
