abstract: In this paper, the production decisions across multiple energy suppliers in smart grid, powering cellular networks are investigated. The suppliers are characterized by different offered prices and pollutant emissions levels. The challenge is to decide the amount of energy provided by each supplier to each of the operators such that their profitability is maximized while respecting the maximum tolerated level of CO2 emissions. The cellular operators are characterized by their offered quality of service (QoS) to the subscribers and the number of users that determines their energy requirements. Stochastic geometry is used to determine the average power needed to achieve the target probability of coverage for each operator. The total average power requirements of all networks are fed to an optimization framework to find the optimal amount of energy to be provided from each supplier to the operators. The generalized alpha-fair utility function is used to avoid production bias among the suppliers based on profitability of generation. Results illustrate the production behavior of the energy suppliers versus QoS level, cost of energy, capacity of generation, and level of fairness.
