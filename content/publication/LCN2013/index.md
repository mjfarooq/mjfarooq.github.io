abstract: In this paper, we present a game theoretic framework for spectrum allocation in distributed cognitive radio networks containing both unicast and broadcast traffic. Our proposed scheme aims to minimize broadcast latency for broadcast traffic and minimize interference and access contention for both types of traffic. We develop a utility function that ensures that both objectives are met yielding a higher network throughput. Our proposed spectrum allocation game is also formulated as a potential game and is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium if the sequential best response dynamics is followed. A proof of concept of the proposed algorithm has been implemented on the Orbit radio testbed and the results verify the convergence of the potential game. Our simulation and experimental results also reveal that the choice of utility function improves the average network throughput for a mixed traffic profile.
