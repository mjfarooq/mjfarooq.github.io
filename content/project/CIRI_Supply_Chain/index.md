The security of the Internet of things (IoTs) depends on not only the security of the software and hardware components but also their supply chains. Recent cyber-attacks, such as the one related to Solar Winds and Kaseya, have clearly demonstrated the involvement of supply chain actors. The complex IoT supply chain network involves many disconnected actors and organizations that design and integrate different subcomponents of an IoT device. The insecurity of one subcomponent in the supply chain can have downstream effects on the security and resiliency of IoT-enabled systems. Considering a typical Information and Communication Technology IoT (ICT/IoT) system, there is a complex integration of multiple components enabling various functions. Each component is supplied by a vendor or a network of vendors, which have different levels of trustworthiness from the perspective of the stakeholders. Certain suppliers may have a long-standing history of successful operation and comply with essential cybersecurity practices. On the other hand, there may be many newer and potentially less secure vendors, which may introduce unknown vulnerabilities to the overall system security. The supply chain front adds another dimension to the system reliability on top of component reliabilities. Furthermore, a particular component in the system may itself be very reliable but may have been procured from a less trustworthy vendor. Similarly, a component may not be very reliable but may have a highly trustworthy supplier. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the delicate interplay between component reliabilities and the trustworthiness of their suppliers.

This research aims to provide the necessary tools leveraging principled and quantitative understanding and assessment of the IoT supply chain risks to critical infrastructure owners and operators. We are developing software-based solutions to (i) measure the risks posed by vendors to the system security; (ii) analyze the compliance of cybersecurity best practices; (iii) assist in deployment and upgrade decisions relating to the supply chain; and (iv) prioritize security resources on vendor screening.
