Military and tactical units are required to operate in regions where a dedicated and trusted communications infrastructure may or may not be available. In order to conduct complex, dangerous and time-sensitive operations, there is an inherent need to communicate effectively, efficiently, and securely at all times, often relying on third-party fifth generation (5G) networks that may not be secure and trustworthy due to the potential involvement of malicious or compromised threat actors. It is important to have the ability to operate
on untrusted indigenous 5G infrastructure and at the same time, seamlessly and securely connect with devices on trusted tactical networks (as shown in Fig. 1). With a growing threat landscape and attack surfaces in 5G systems, a promising approach to tackle the security challenges is to create a holistic Zero Trust approach, which assumes that an attacker is already in the system and adopts the principle of “never trust, always verify”. It is critical to monitor and evaluate the trust posture of the tactical endpoints proactively and continuously to design security policies that verify the identity of the devices, detect malicious users or processes, and respond to attacks and changing threats. A formal and automated quantification of trust is a desideratum for decision-making regarding access control, system configurations, and performance evaluation. Towards creating an overlay of proactive and automated end-to-end zero-trust security & resilience mechanisms over the tactical 5G network cloud infrastructures, this research aims at developing capabilities for (i) autonomously monitoring tactical endpoint devices, their activities, and interactions with the indigenous 5G network; (ii) dynamically evaluating the trust level of the tactical devices and observable components of the indigenous 5G networks; (iii) adaptively learning optimal performance routes and orchestrating network resources for trustworthy communications; (iv) strategically micro-segmenting 5G apps, processes, and workloads in the cloud to prevent lateral movement of attacks; and (v) proactively controlling access management based on trust.
