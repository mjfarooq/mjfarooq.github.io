UAVs have proven to be a convenient choice for providing on-demand wireless connectivity in disasters and emergency scenarios. They are also critical in enhancing and improving the service gaps in fifth generation (5G) cellular networks. In certain situations such as public events, gatherings, parades, or sporting events, there may be a need to supplement the cellular networks with small cell base stations (BSs) mounted on UAVs. While several factors play a role in the quality of communication experienced by the users connected to the UAVs, the placement the UAV BSs can be crucial in ensuring the strength of wireless signals between the UAV and the ground users. Moreover, multiple types of users may be present in the network, e.g., those that have subscribed for higher speeds and preferred resource allocation, hereby referred to as premium users, and those that are using standard service, hereby referred to as regular users. Therefore, the placement of UAVs needs to be optimized to cater for the quality of service (QoS) requirements of different users. An illustration of the considered network scenario is shown in Fig. 1, where the premium user and regular user are connected to a network of UAV BSs that are orchestrated in the air to meet the data needs of the users.

This research aims to develop approaches to (i) autonomically configure multi-UAV networks, (ii) optimize
placement according to QoS needs and roles of ground users, (iii) learn and adapt with changes in underlying
user topologies.
